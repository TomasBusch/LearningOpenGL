# Learning OpenGL

This is a project I did at the start of the year, following LearnOpenGL and 
TheCherno's tutorials.

## Controls

AWSD To move
Mouse to move the camera
CTRL to toggle freeing the mouse pointer

## Building

This project uses a Visual Studio solution and vcpkg to handle building and fetching
dependecies. You will need to install an up to date version of [vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-msbuild?pivots=shell-powershell)
and use Visual Studio 2022 or higher (it will probably work with older versions
but is not tested).
